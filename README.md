# HoloCFD

The HoloCFD project introduces a digital environment integrating interactive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations tailored for advanced education in chemical engineering. The architecture employs a client-server network, establishing an automated bidirectional connection linking CFD solvers and a game engine. To surmount computational complexities and resource-intensive features, a content delivery network is structured, alleviating the burden of intricate calculations from end-user devices. A case study involving a shell and tube heat exchanger assesses the application's performance, with results scrutinized for the efficacy of augmented reality (AR) in visualizing simulations. The project aims to democratize the application of CFD models, make them accessible to a broader audience beyond experts in the field, and create a specialized tool for the research and investigation of shell and tube heat exchangers.

The implementation of the project involves the development of a user-friendly AR interface that improves accessibility for users with different levels of experience. This includes the creation of user-friendly controls and interactive elements, such as gesture-based interactions and manipulation of 3D models, in order to establish a smooth and captivating simulation environment. The project also incorporates open-source software for CFD simulations to mitigate budgetary obstacles linked to proprietary solutions. The server automation section deals with the comprehensive management and coordination of a server computer and its interactions with many software applications. Automation is achieved through several methods, with two prominent approaches being the use of scripts and visual-based programming. The chosen automation software is implemented on the server PC and is initiated through the terminal, providing access to a browser-based graphical user interface (GUI).
